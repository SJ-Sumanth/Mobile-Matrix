- [ ] All tests passing (`npm run test:all`)
- [ ] Build successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured in `.env`
- [ ] Secrets properly configured (database passwords, API keys)

### Database Preparation

- [ ] Seed database if needed: `npm run db:seed`
- [ ] Test database connectivity from application

### 3. Application Deployment
- [ ] Build Docker images: `docker-compose build`
- [ ] Start services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
- [ ] Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check application logs: `docker-compose logs app`

### 4. Load Balancer Setup
- [ ] Configure Nginx reverse proxy
- [ ] Test SSL certificate: `curl -I https://your-domain.com`
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test health check endpoint: `curl https://your-domain.com/api/health`

### 5. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Start monitoring stack: `docker-compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d`
- [ ] Access Grafana dashboard: `http://your-domain:3001`
- [ ] Configure alert notifications in AlertManager
- [ ] Test alert delivery (send test alert)

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Security headers present in responses
- [ ] Rate limiting working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive information exposed in logs
- [ ] Authentication working properly

### Monitoring Verification
- [ ] All services showing as healthy in Grafana
- [ ] Metrics being collected correctly
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Log aggregation working
- [ ] Backup system operational

## Backup and Recovery Setup

### Backup Configuration
- [ ] Automated database backups scheduled
- [ ] Backup retention policy configured
- [ ] Cloud storage backup configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Backup verification script tested
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented and tested

### Disaster Recovery

- [ ] Contact information current

## Go-Live Checklist

### Final Verification
- [ ] All previous checklist items completed
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of deployment
- [ ] Support team briefed on new deployment
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared and tested
- [ ] Monitoring alerts active

### Go-Live Activities
- [ ] DNS cutover (if applicable)
- [ ] Traffic routing to new deployment
- [ ] Monitor application performance for first hour
- [ ] Verify user functionality
- [ ] Check error rates and response times

### Post Go-Live
- [ ] Send deployment completion notification
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review meeting
- [ ] Update status page (if applicable)
- [ ] Archive deployment artifacts
- [ ] Update change management records

## Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Detected
- [ ] Stop new deployment: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Restore previous version: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Restore database from backup (if needed)
- [ ] Verify rollback successful
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of rollback

### Post-Rollback
- [ ] Investigate root cause of deployment failure
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update deployment procedures
- [ ] Plan remediation for next deployment attempt
